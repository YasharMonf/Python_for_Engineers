    "### What Is a Variable?\n",
    "A variable is a name that refers to a value. In the previous example, we saw that we can use Python as an advanced calculator. However, the results of these computations are lost after we perform our operations. If we want to save and reuse any value in a code, we need to save these computations in a place in computer memory to be able to access it in the future.\n",

    "While responses from generative AI tools can often be helpful, they are not always reliable. These tools sometimes generate plausible but incorrect or misleading information, so (just as with an answer found on the internet) it is essential to verify their accuracy. You need the knowledge and skills to be able to understand these responses, to judge whether or not they are accurate, and to fix any errors in the code it offers you. Additionally, the models used by these tools have been “trained” on very large volumes of data, much of it taken from the internet, and the responses they produce reflect that training data, and may recapitulate its inaccuracies or biases. The environmental costs (energy and water use) of LLMs are a lot higher than other technologies, both during development (known as training) and when an individual user uses one (also called inference).
